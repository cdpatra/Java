//    WRAPPER CLASSES
//    There are wrapper class for every primitive data type in java
//    -> this class encapsulates a single value for the primitive data type
//    -> for instance the wrapper class for int is Integer, for float is Float, and so on.

//    PRIMITIVE->WRAPPER
//    boolean -> Boolean
//    byte -> Byte
//    char -> Character
//    short -> Short
//    int -> Integer
//    long -> Long
//    float -> Float
//    double -> Double
