    /*
     * packages are nothing more than the way we organise files into different directories
     * according to their functionality, usability as wel as category they should belong to
     * */

    /*
     * Files in one directory (or package) would have different functionality from those of another directory */

    /*
     * for example: files in java.io package do something related to I/O, but files in java.net package
     * give us the way to deal with the Network
     * */

    /* packaging also help us to avoid class NAME COLLISION when we use the same class name as that of others*/
